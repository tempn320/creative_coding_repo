# Final Project Proposal - Natalie Temple

For my final project, I want to use python to create some data visualizations (similar to those I created for assignment 6) that I can use for my thesis. I made one test visualization to experiment with this idea which I have included below.


## Assignment 6 Data Visualizations

<img src="highest_rates.png" width="300" alt="highest incarceration rates bar chart.">

<img src="lowest_rates.png" width="300" alt="lowest incarceration rates bar chart.">

## Test Data Visualization

<img src="us_total.png" width="300" alt="U.S. incarceration rates over time.">
